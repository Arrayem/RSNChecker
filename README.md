# RS Name Checker [WIP]
<strong>RS Name Checker</strong> is a python script with a GUI that allows you to search for a username and see if it's still available. Please note, if it says a name is available, it doesn't always mean it is. This could be for a number of reasons, like the account is banned or has been inactive for a long period of time and the RS Hiscores or RunePixels hasn't updated their info. <br />
