# üîé RSNChecker
RSNChecker is an open-source project written in Python that allows you to search for a Runescape name to see if it's available. You can search for either a single username or enter multiple usernames (we tested 500 usernames at once) with the added benefit of either checking OSRS hiscores, RS3 hiscores, or RunePixels for a return on availability.
