# RS Name Checker [WIP]
<strong>RS Name Checker</strong> is a python script with a GUI that allows you to search for a username and see if it's still available. Please note, if it says a name is "maybe available", it doesn't always mean it is. This could be for a number of reasons, like the account is banned or has been inactive for a long period of time, thus the username won't be available, it will always return "maybe available" as there is no real way to check this information.
