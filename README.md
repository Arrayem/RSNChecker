# üîé RSNChecker [v1.5]
**RSNChecker** is an open-source project written in Python that allows you to search for a Runescape name to see if it's available. You can search for either a single username or enter multiple usernames (I've tested 500 usernames at once) with the added benefit of either checking OSRS Hiscores or RS3 Hiscores.

+ You can change how many names to generate by editing the generate functions
```python
def two_letter_func(name_entry):
    names = ["".join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters, k=2)) for _ in range(50)]
    name_entry.delete(0, "end")
    name_entry.insert(0, ",".join(names))
```
+ Where it says `for _ in range(50)` change `50` to your desired number output.
